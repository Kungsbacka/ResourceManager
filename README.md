# Resource Manager

Resource Manager is a tool for creating user resources. It can currently:
* Create mailbox - both on-prem and in Office 365
* Enable Office 365 sync and set licenses
* Enable Skype on-prem
* Create home folder
* Create SAML identity

Just like Lifecycle Manager, Resource Manager is built specifically for Kungsbacka kommun and is not meant for general use.
